# Fake-News-Analysis-using-Pythons
Fake News is One of the biggest issue that we face and is quite challenging to counter act. 
This program tends to solve this issue in a quicker and precise manner.
I've used a News dataset availble, 
The Dataset having dimensions of (6335, 4)(R*C)
It is a news data set having Texts that we often recieve and see over Whatsapp, Facebook, SMS etc.
I've implemented a TfidVectorizer here and then initialized a Passive Aggressive Classifier to finally fit my model.
The output was an Accuracy of 92.9% which makes this quite trustable model and eligible to be considered for practical implementaitons.
